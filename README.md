# Screensavers!

This is the [Before Dawn](http://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn)
screensaver repository. It's basically a collection of all the
screensavers that the app installs by default. If you would like to
preview them before installing, you can get a quick
[preview of the screensavers](http://muffinista.github.io/before-dawn-screensavers/).

## How Do I Contribute?

If you would like to write your own screensaver, you can get a head
start by looking at the code in the __template directory of this repo.
You can make a copy of those files to get started. There's a bunch
more information about this in the
[README](https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn/blob/master/README.md)
for the application.
